Update 8.0.....

Now is to make the report section more detailed with graphs and a comparison of reports.

For this, we have to create tags. The user should have the power to create sub-tags and their sub-tags.

How would it work...

1. In the expense section. Before detailing, the user would have the option to select a tag. The user can select any tag, but only one. For example,e iI i have a Tag>Sub-tag>Subtag. (Stationary>Uni>Ballpoint). The user selects First Tag. It would be Stationary only. But if the user selects a ballpoint. The program would know its. Ballpoint from Uni from Stationery. So, it would work that way during Reports.

There should be a search button over tags and over friends in the split section to find a friend quickly if the user is having any issues. Also, the tags and friends used recently should be on top.

2. Also, expense graphs in the reports section. Do it the best way. If any change is needed, we'll do it in the next update.

3. If there is no friend. It should be in the Friends ledger. (Add friends in settings. (Under this line) Upper right corner "Settings Symbol")

4. Remove Help Tutorial from settings.
