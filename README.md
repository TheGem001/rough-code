## 📜 The Concept

Welcome to the **Rough-Code Archive**. If my main repositories are the gallery, this is the workshop. 

This space is dedicated to the raw, unfiltered learning process of a Software Engineering student. It houses the late-night exam preparations, the trial-and-error HTML snippets, and the iterative stages of university semester projects. It is chaotic by design, serving as a personal digital scratchpad.
Here I keep my code for testing. You may also find some half finished projects here.
